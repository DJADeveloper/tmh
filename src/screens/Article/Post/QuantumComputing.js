                Quantum computers operate on the principles of quantum
                mechanics, using qubits to perform calculations. This allows
                them to handle tasks at speeds unimaginable for traditional
                computers. The potential applications are vast, from drug
                discovery and financial modeling to climate science and
                cryptography.
